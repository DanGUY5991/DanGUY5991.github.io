            <h3>Who I Am</h3>
            <p>I am a strategist and researcher who focuses on <strong>sensemaking</strong>—helping people understand complex situations so they can act wisely.</p>
            <p>I work with leaders and organizations to bring clarity, meaning, and alignment to moments of change, especially around strategy and new technologies like AI. My goal is not just to give answers, but to help people understand <em>what is happening</em>, <em>why it matters</em>, and <em>what to do next</em>.</p>
